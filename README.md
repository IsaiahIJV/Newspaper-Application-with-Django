# Newspaper-Application-with-Django
I used Ubuntu to create this newspaper application. 
An application I made following a django for beginners book.
In order to utilize this repo, I would suggest downloading the latest version of python.
python --version #this is to check what version of python you have
pip3 install pipenv #this is to install Python 3
Once you are done with this you should make a virtual enviorment. 
pipenv install django==2.1 then pipenv shell
After you have followed these steps then you can download my repo to test the newspaper App yourself.
